Website Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap
This repository provides a basic introduction to website development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. It includes instructions on how to build a basic webpage from scratch and how to deploy it using GitHub Pages.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies used in creating websites:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 
creates the structure and content of a web page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the HTML content.
JavaScript makes the web page interactive.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three primary technologies used in creating websites. Here is a brief description of how each of them is used:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website. It's used to create the basic structure and content of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images etc.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML content. It describes how HTML elements are displayed on the screen, in terms of their colors, layouts, fonts, sizes etc.

JavaScript is a scripting language that's used to make web pages interactive. It can be used to create dynamic content, handle events (like user clicks or key presses), validate input data, manage cookies, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and much more.

Media queries in CSS allows a website to look different under different conditions, making a site responsive. This technology is heavily used by Bootstrap to create a responsive grid system. In a nutshell, the grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page, and you can specify how many columns a specific HTML element should take up at different screen sizes.

The Bootstrap grid system is a flexible, mobile-first layout system that's used to control the page's layout across multiple screen sizes. It's based on a 12-column layout, which allows for different kinds of complex layouts.
