  <p>Nicole Vada is a newbie to the comedy world, however her quick punchlines and story telling humor has won her fans of all ages. Residing in Atlanta, Nicole has performed in several venues in the North and South east corridor:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Uptown Comedy Corner - Atlanta, Georgia</li>
    <li>Laughing Skull - Atlanta, Georgia</li>

    <li>Warm Daddies - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</li>
    <li>Cab Calloway High School of the Performing Arts - Wilmington, Delaware</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An intensive 6 week improv training class with Rodney Perry has become Nicole’s new platform to fortify her craft: “practice, practice, practice makes perfect”. She recently worked along “Pierre” as Script Supervisor for #PierreUncensored which was recently picked up by Kevin Hart’s new platform. Nicole also played several characters in the skits. As a child model/actor Nicole has appeared in national campaign ads and she is experienced in stage plays, acting, and vocal performances.</p>

  <p>Nicole has a passion for marketing and promotions. This can be seen by the numbers of followers she has on social media. Nicole recreated herself by losing 70 pounds while fighting Narcolepsy/Cataplexy. She considers herself the “Product” and wants her transformation to encourage others to laugh while remaining determined. Nicole Vada has literally increased her fanbase by the thousands.</p>
